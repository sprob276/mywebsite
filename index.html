            <h2>Parkinson's Disease</h2>
            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>Parkinson’s disease is a type of neurodegenerative disorder, which impacts the brain, and then effects the nervous system which are nerve cells in your body that controls movement. Parkinson’s directly impacts these nerve cells which impacts your ability to control your body and can cause uncontrollable movements. Progression gets worse as you age, and it can impair your ability to walk or talk. </p> 
            <p>Since Parkinson’s disease impacts your brain, as progression increases, it can also impact behaviour, memory, and cognitive functions. Parkinson’s disease generally impacts individuals around the age of 60 and risk gradually increase after that. Early on-set Parkinson’s disease is before the age of 50, with only around 5-10% of people are diagnosed. </p>
            
            <h3>Symptoms</h3>
            <p>
                Symptoms vary for everyone, and it is not noticeable at onset of disease. Symptoms gradually get worse over time, and most commonly starts on one side of the body and slowly impacts the entire body, while still being worse on the original side it started on. These are the most common symptoms:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Tremors:</b> shaking is the most common symptom and usually involves shaking in fingers and hands. It can happen to other parts of the body too, and it can get worse in times of stress.</li>
                    <li><b>Rigid Muscles:</b> some muscles may be stiff in your body and can become painful.</li>
                    <li><b>Trouble speaking:</b> since Parkinson’s affect the nerve cells, it can affect facial muscles, which makes people speak more quietly or less often. They might also slur their words or not finish their sentences since it impacts their brain related to memory or thinking.</li>
                    <li><b>Decrease in automatic movement:</b> with the combination of Parkinson’s impacting brain function and movement, some automatic moving such as blinking may not happen as often.</li>
                    <li><b>Slower movement:</b> impacts your ability to move fast, making it harder to complete daily tasks.</li>
                    <li><b>Other non-movement related symptoms</b> other symptoms such as mental health problems occur and will be discussed below.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Causes</h3>
            <p>Parkinson’s disease is neurological, meaning it impacts the nerve cells of the brain. The area affected in which these cells are affected is in the basal ganglia.

<!-- Java Integration-->
            <p>The basal ganglia is a part of the brain that is associated with the control of movement. It is linked with your nerve cells that are associated with controlling movements towards your joints. It sends signals from your brain to your body, through the spine towards your muscles, in order to execute movement. If the signal is rejected, it goes into an area of the brain where it suppresses the signal.</p>
            <p>Parkinson’s disease directly impacts the nerve cells in the basal ganglia, causing them to disappear. This area of the brain is also associated with non-declarative memory, which is a type of long-term memory that is nonconscious. Contrast to what people believe in, nondeclarative memory is complex but comes easily to people, as it is stuff that we do automatically. Since movement is a type of non-declarative memory and happens automatically, the basal ganglia is associated with movement, and when impacted it is linked with your nerve cells and impairs your ability to control your movement.</p>
